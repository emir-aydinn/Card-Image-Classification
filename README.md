# Card-Image-Classification
This is the image classification project by using Decision Tree, Random Forest and CNNs

## Introduction
Our goal in this project is to recognize and classify playing cards from a dataset. The playing card images in the dataset come in a variety of colors, sizes, and fonts. We implement three separate machine learning algorithms to accomplish this goal: three classifiers: a convolutional neural network, a decision tree classifier, and a random forest classifier (CNN). Multiple decision trees are used in Random Forest, a common ensemble learning technique, to classify instances. It has a reputation for being highly accurate and resistant to overfitting. Contrarily, Decision Tree is a straightforward and understandable method that creates a tree-like model of decisions and potential consequences. Although it is simple to comprehend and put into practice, overfitting can occur. Finally, CNNs are a special class of neural network that thrive at image categorization tasks. Following fully connected layers, they are made up of Multiple convolutional and pooling layers. They have a solid reputation for excelling at picture classification challenges and learning hierarchical representations of images. The three algorithms will be trained and tested on the playing card dataset, and their performance will be compared in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, and other metrics. The objective is to understand the benefits and drawbacks of each.
